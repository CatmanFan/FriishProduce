        **How to update manually:**
        \n  * Extract the files to your FriishProduce directory, overwriting the older versions, and delete any leftover files or folders that are no longer needed.
        \n  * It is recommended to also clear your previous settings by deleting the FriishProduce folder in your user's local app data directory.\n\n

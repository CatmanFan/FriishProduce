Wii Virtual Console 'CCF' archiver/extractor suite
by paulguy/aeduo (paulguy one one nine at gmail dot com)  released under Public 
Domain, but I ask that you give credit if you use any of the code.

This package contains these files:
README - this readme
ccfex.c - CCF extractor source
ccfarc.c - CCF archiver source
ccfex - CCF extractor linux binary
ccfarc - CCF archiver linux binary
ccfex.exe - CCF extractor Windows binary
ccfarc.exe - CCF archiver Windows binary

The Windows program might work out of the box, but it might require zlib1.dll in 
it's own directory or your path.

This program should compile easily on any system, since all it uses is standard C 
libraries and zlib.  The command should be something like:

gcc -lz -o ccfex ccfex.c

In Windows/mingw32, -lz should go at the end, but it doesn't matter where it goes 
in Linux.

Sometimes on Windows/mingw32, zlib doesn't get found right away, because of the 
default installation prefix for zlib of /usr/local, so you'll need to do 
something like:

gcc -I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib -o ccfex.exe ccfex.c -lz

ANYWAY, now how to use it.  Should be similar on both systems, from the command 
line you can do something like:

ccfex ccffile.ccf

to extract a ccf file.  Or:

ccfarc file1.dat file2.rom file3.arc file4.smc

to store those files to out.ccf.

If you're using a file manager, you should be able to just drag the files in to 
the executable and have it act on them just the same.

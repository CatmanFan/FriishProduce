**FriishProduce** is a WAD injector for Wii/vWii, which allows for automated ROM replacement in Wii channels.
This application is designed to streamline the process to as few third-party programs as possible.

***The project and readme are currently under work-in-progress and will be updated over the course of time.***

---

## Features
This injector bypasses other third-party assets (such as Common-Key.bin, most of HowardC's tools, and Autoinjectuwad/Devilken's VC) by handling many steps directly from the program's code. Some examples:
* WAD/U8 handling using libWiiSharp
* VC ROM injection through hex writing and/or file replacement
* Automatic banner/icon editing
* Automatic editing of source WAD's savedata where available
* Additional content/emulator options for each platform where supported
* Replace WAD contents with forwarder to auto-load specific emulator core and ROM

## How-to
Please see the [Wiki](https://github.com/CatmanFan/FriishProduce/wiki/Setup) for instructions on setup and usage.

**Make sure you have a (v)Wii NAND backup in case anything goes wrong!**

See [here](https://github.com/CatmanFan/FriishProduce/wiki/Translation) for a how-to on translating the app.

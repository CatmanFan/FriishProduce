**FriishProduce** is a WAD channel injector/creator for (v)Wii. It can be used to convert ROMs, disc images or other types of software to installable WADs for Wii/vWii (Wii U). This includes injectable Virtual Console (VC) games, as well as single ROM loaders (SRLs), and Adobe Flash files.
This application is designed to streamline the process to as few third-party programs as possible.

## Features
This injector bypasses other third-party assets (such as Common-Key.bin, HowardC's tools, and Autoinjectuwad/Devilken's VC) by handling many steps directly from the program's code. Some examples:
* Automatic WAD/U8/CCF handling
* VC ROM injection through hex writing and/or file replacement
* Automatic banner/icon editing
* Automatic editing of source WAD's savedata where available
* Additional content/emulator options for each platform where supported
* Replace WAD contents with forwarder to auto-load specific emulator core and ROM

### Platforms

  * *Virtual Console*:
    * Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) / Famicom

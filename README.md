# FriishProduce
**FriishProduce** is a channel injector for (v)Wii, which allows for ROM replacement and customization in Virtual Console WADs.
This application is designed to streamline the process to as few third-party programs as possible.

***The project and readme are currently under work-in-progress and will be updated over the course of time.***

## How-to
Please see the [Wiki](https://github.com/CatmanFan/FriishProduce/wiki/Setup) for instructions on setup and usage.

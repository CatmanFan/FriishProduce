## Getting started
The menu strip above includes several icons for project functions to the top-left. This includes buttons to **browse for a ROM** (*the disc icon*) or for **an image** (*the photo icon*), to **save the project** as a proprietary format (*the floppy disk icon*) or to **export as a WAD** (*the box icon*), and to **retrieve game metadata online** (*the LibRetro icon*). You can also close the current project from this menu (this will discard all unsaved data). These can all also be accessed from the "Project" menu above the icons set.

## Creating a project
1. Open the "New..." dropdown menu, then select a console.
2. Open a ROM file.
3. Add an image.
4. Fill in all the fields.
5. Click on the Export button, and save your WAD/ZIP.

## Project settings & content options
* You can **choose which base channel to use** to inject into, and which region of said channel, or you can **get a separate offline WAD file** to use instead. Some VC bases may have different compatibility or more features than other VC bases.
* When selecting a ROM, in certain instances you can also optionally **add a patch file** (.ips / .bps / .xdelta). Clicking the Import patch checkbox in the ROM information section will open a browse file dialog where you can search for your desired patch file, after which it will be applied to the ROM itself when it's injected.
* You can also edit some of the other options available, such as your **image's interpolation mode**, the **WAD title ID**, or the **content options for the current injection method** (clicking on the gear icon next to the methods list will open up a separate options menu).
* You can also import a **[custom VC manual with edited HTML and/or image files](vc-manual.md)** tailed to your game, use the original manual, or use none altogether.
* If you want to avoid using Virtual Console altogether, you can **change the injection method and use an emulator forwarder** instead in the content options section.
* You can **change the WAD region**.

## Finishing
Once you're done, click on the box icon and choose a location and/or filename to save your WAD to. If you are creating a forwarder, this will also create a separate ZIP file in the same path, which you will have to extract to your Wii SD or USB root (the WAD will not work otherwise).
If you encounter any issues with the current version, please feel free to notify at the FriishProduce GitHub repo, or on its release thread on GBAtemp.

In case you prefer to change any of the details you have later, you can also choose to save your project by clicking on the floppy disk icon.

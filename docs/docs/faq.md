## Application

* **Q:** *When opening FriishProduce, I get an application crash error message with the code BEX and StackHash_c2c0 (or similar), instead of the GUI.*<br />
  **A:** This may be because of your antivirus program. You can make an exception for the FriishProduce app/folder in your antivirus software settings. If that still doesn't work, then try temporarily disabling the antivirus software or restarting your computer.

## Virtual Console

* **Q:** *My injected ROM crashes or is stuck on the message that reads "You will need a Classic Controller."*<br />
  **A:** If you're injecting a Nintendo 64 ROM, please be aware that the VC emulator actually has very low compatibility with most of the N64 game library. As a result, most ROMs will simply crash on loading, and it is instead recommended to use an emulator forwarder for these games.
  
* **Q:** *My injected ROM cannot load because it says the game is not designed for my system or was meant for another region. What do I do?*<br />
  **A:** It is likely that your ROM is region-locked and does not match the region used by the VC WAD (e.g. NTSC ROM injected into a PAL50 base). Try again using the region corresponding to your ROM.

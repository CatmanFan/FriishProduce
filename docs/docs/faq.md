## Virtual Console

* **Q:** *My injected ROM crashes or is stuck on the message that reads "You will need a Classic Controller." What do I do?*<br />
  **A:** If you're injecting a Nintendo 64 ROM, please be aware that the VC emulator actually has very low compatibility with most of the N64 game library. As a result, most ROMs will simply crash on loading, and it is instead recommended to use an emulator forwarder for these games.
  
* **Q:** *My injected ROM is stuck on an error that says the game is not designed for my system or was meant for another region. What do I do?*<br />
  **A:** Your ROM is region-locked, and does not match the region used by the VC WAD (e.g. NTSC ROM injected into a PAL50 base). Try again using the region corresponding to your ROM.

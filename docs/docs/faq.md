* **Q:** *My Virtual Console inject crashes or is stuck on the message that reads "You will need a Classic Controller." What do I do?*<br />
  **A:** If you're injecting a Nintendo 64 ROM, please be aware that the VC emulator actually has very low compatibility with most of the N64 game library. As a result, most ROMs will simply crash on loading, and it is instead recommended to use an emulator forwarder for these games.

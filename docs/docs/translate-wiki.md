# Translating this wiki

## Translating strings
To add translated pages in your language for this wiki:

	1. Go to [the `docs` folder](https://github.com/CatmanFan/FriishProduce/tree/main/docs/docs) over at the FriishProduce repository.
	2. Download the .md files located in the root of the aforementioned `docs` folder.
	3. Create a local folder with the name of your target locale (e.g. `ja` for Japanese), and place your downloaded .md files there.
	4. Open each .md file with a text editor (e.g. Notepad++) and translate accordingly.
	5. Create a pull request to upload your locale folder. It must be stored at `docs/docs/[locale]`.
	
## Proofreading
Alternatively, you are also welcome to proofread and correct any of the existing translations using a similar method, by downloading the respective locale folder and editing each .md file.
